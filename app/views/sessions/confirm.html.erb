<%= form_for current_session, :url => {:action => :validate} do |f| %>
  <%= f.text_field :validation_code %>
  <%= f.submit 'Validate' %>
<% end %>

<p>This device will be remembered for 30 days.  If you haven't received the validation email you can <%= link_to 'send another one', resend_session_path(current_session) %>.</p>
